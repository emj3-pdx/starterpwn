# Purpose

This is one of my first attempts at writing a pwn challenge. It's not
terribly different from many other easy-ish pwn challenges, but it was
written from scratch on a whim. While this isn't directly taken or
based upon one specific challenge as far as I'm aware, it's not the
most original work. Credit for inspiration and the knowledge that let
me write this goes to all the other challenge authors out there whose
pwn challenges I've attempted and sometimes even managed to solve!

CTFs that deserve some credit for leading me down this path:

- OregonCTF challenges
- OSUSec's DamCTF 2020 (Spring and Fall)
- NCL
- CSI CTF 2020
- UTCTF 2020

# Prompt

A starter pwn challenge masquerading as a program that sets a
password on first use. Can you get it to accept your password?
